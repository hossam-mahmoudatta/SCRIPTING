So how to think about this project?

I can create it in a gui that will display everything
when the gui starts:
1. a popup will show a welcome msg, with buttons next or cancel
2. next is two options, sign up / login
3.1 sign up: will ask for first name, last name, email, password, confirm password, mobile(validated)

3.2 sign in: will sign in by checking the database for created users
4. after sign in or sign up, it will show the inner main menu
5. the main menu will have 3 options: dashboard, profile, logout -->
